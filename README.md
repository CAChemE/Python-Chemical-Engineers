# Python for Chemical Engineers
Python crash course designed for chemical engineers and scientists with no previous knowledge. The real goal here isnâ€™t to teach you everything about Python, but you will learn basic concepts via something you will need to do soon or later: analyze data. These informal lessons are divided into 1 hour/week and will be based on [Software-Carpentry Lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html)

## Day #0
* Motivation of learning Python and [why Nature recommends it](http://www.nature.com/news/programming-pick-up-python-1.16833) ([live demo!](http://www.nature.com/news/ipython-interactive-demo-7.21492)). [[1](https://speakerdeck.com/fperez/ipython-and-project-jupyter-a-language-independent-architecture-for-open-computing-and-data-science), [2](http://www.slideshare.net/teoliphant/python-as-the-zen-of-data-science), [3](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/pycon2014-keynote/blob/master/Index.ipynb)]
* Installation of Python in your computer. Please, [download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Python 3.5 (64-bit) [(why?)](http://www.slideshare.net/continuumio/distributed-computing-on-your-cluster-with-anaconda-webinar-2015)
* Introduction to the material we will follow: [Software-Carpentry Lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html) (+[other](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks) [resources](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/))
* Open discussion


## Day #1: NumPy 
 *   Explain what a library is, and what libraries are used for.
 *   Load a Python library and use the things it contains.
 *   Read tabular data from a file into a program.
 *   Assign values to variables.
 *   Select individual values and subsections from data.
 *   Perform operations on arrays of data.
 *   Display simple graphs.
 
Materials:
- [Download the data](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/)
- [Read the full lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/01-numpy/)

## Day #2: Loops and lists 
 *   Explain what a for loop does.
 *   Correctly write for loops to repeat simple calculations.
 *   Trace changes to a loop variable as the loop runs.
 *   Trace changes to other variables as they are updated by a for loop.
 *   Explain what a list is.
 *   Create and index lists of simple values.

## Day #3: Lists and how to proces multiple files
 *   Explain what a list is (recap).
 *   Create and index lists of simple values (recap).
 
## Day #5: Lists and how to proces multiple files

 *   Use a library function to get a list of filenames that match a simple wildcard pattern.
 *   Use a for loop to process multiple files.
 *   Plotting graphs (recap)
